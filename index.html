<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Galaga game was developed by Namco LTD. Please see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga">Galaga Wikipedia</a> page
for further details on the game. The Galaga characters used in this implementation of the game were extracted from the images
from the Wikipedia page.</p>

<p>This project is an educational project assigned by <a href="https://udacity.com">Udacity</a> as part of their Front-End Web Developer
Nanodegree. The project assigned is actually a horizontal/vertical movement game that did not require non-linear motion. I chose
to attempt a recreation of the Galaga game for two reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>Galaga was a game I played as a youth at Funland in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. There are many fond memories of throwing
shiny quarters into the slot of the Galaga game during summer vacations.</li>
<li>Galaga offered an opportunity to implement non-linear movement.</li>
</ol>

<p>For those that are fans of the Galaga game series, please accept my apologies for the poor implementation, it is after
all a learning project.</p>

<h3>

<ol>

<ol>
<li>The fighter will move left or right by pressing the arrow keys on a standard keyboard.</li>
<li>To fire missiles, press the spacebar.</li>
